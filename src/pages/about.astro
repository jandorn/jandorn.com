      I am a web developer with experience in both frontend and backend
      technologies. I love working on various hardware and software projects.
      Currently, I'm a graduade student in Business & Computer Science at the
      Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. 
      Additionally, I work as a working student at <a href="https://finanzguru.de" target="_blank">Finanzguru</a> as a data analyst.

      When I am not working or studying, I love traveling, exploring new places
      and immersing myself in diverse cultures around the world. Through my
      blog, I enjoy sharing my thoughts, experiences, and interesting parts of
      my work. This website servers as a personal showcase, giving you a glimpse
      into both my professional journey and the passions that fuel my
      creativity.
